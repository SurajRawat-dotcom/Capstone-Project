# Capstone-Project
Intensity Analysis using NLP and Python involves building a model to analyze the strength or intensity of emotions, sentiments, or topics in a text. This technique helps in determining not just the sentiment (positive/negative) but also the degree of sentiment (e.g., very positive, slightly negative).

Steps to Build:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of labeled text with varying intensity of sentiments or emotions (e.g., tweets, reviews).

Text Preprocessing: Clean the text data (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.) and tokenize it.

Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate model for intensity prediction, such as:

Traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM).
Deep learning models (LSTM, BERT).
Model Training: Train the model using labeled data with varying intensity levels.

Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or F1 score to evaluate the intensity prediction performance.

Deployment: Deploy the model as a web service or API to analyze intensity in real-time using Python frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
